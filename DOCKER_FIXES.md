# Docker Configuration Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Obsolete Version Field
**Problem**: Docker Compose warned about obsolete `version: '3.8'` field
**Solution**: Removed the version field as it's no longer needed in modern Docker Compose

### 2. Invalid Service Dependency
**Problem**: API service had `depends_on: train` which created invalid dependency
**Solution**: Removed the dependency since API service doesn't actually need train service to be running

## Changes Made

### docker-compose.yaml
- Removed `version: '3.8'` line
- Removed `depends_on: - train` from api service
- All profiles now work independently

### Updated Scripts
- Enhanced `scripts/test_containers.sh` to test all profiles
- Updated validation to use profile-specific configuration checks

### Documentation
- Updated `docs/DOCKER.md` with correct usage examples
- Added detached mode examples

## Verification

All docker-compose profiles now work correctly:
- `docker-compose --profile train up train` ✅
- `docker-compose --profile api up api` ✅  
- `docker-compose --profile dev up api-dev` ✅
- `docker-compose --profile full up` ✅

## Testing

Run `make docker-validate` to verify all configurations are working properly.
